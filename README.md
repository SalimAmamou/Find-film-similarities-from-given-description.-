Find film similarities from given description. Context: datacamp lab
#
the goal of this project is to use NLP to find the degree of similarity between movies based on their plots available on IMDb and Wikipedia.
The dataset contains the titles of the top 100 movies on IMDb as well as each movie's plot summary from both IMDb and Wikipedia.
#
steps:
1. Import and observe dataset
2. Combine Wikipedia and IMDb plot summaries
3. Tokenization
4. Stemming
5. Club together Tokenize & Stem
6. Create TfidfVectorizer
7. Fit transform TfidfVectorizer
8. Import KMeans and create clusters
9. Calculate similarity distance
10. Import Matplotlib, Linkage, and Dendrograms
11. Create merging and plot dendrogram
12. Which movies are most similar?
